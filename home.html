        <h3 class="title">Personal Life</h3>
        <div class="des">
            <p>In 1953, Dutt married Geeta Roy Chowdhuri (later, Geeta Dutt), a well-known playback singer whom he met
                during the making of Baazi (1951). The couple had been engaged for three years, overcoming a great deal
                of family opposition in order to marry. After marriage, in 1956, they moved to a bungalow in Pali Hill,
                Mumbai. They eventually had three children, Tarun, Arun, and Ninaafter the death of Guru and Geeta, the
                children grew up in the homes of Guru's brother Atma Ram and Geeta's brother Mukul Roy.</p>
            <p>Dutt had an unhappy marital life. According to Atma Ram, he was "a strict disciplinarian as far as work
                was concerned, but totally undisciplined in his personal life." He smoked and drank heavily and kept odd
                hours. Dutt's relationship with actress Waheeda Rehman also worked against their marriage. At the time
                of his death, he had separated from Geeta and was living alone. Geeta Dutt died in 1972 at age 41, after
                excessive drinking, which resulted in liver damage.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="title">Career</h3>
        <div class="des">
            <p>After his time with Prabhat failed in 1947, Dutt moved to Bombay, where he worked with two leading
                directors of the time: Amiya Chakravarty in Girls' School (1949) and Gyan Mukherjee in the Bombay
                Talkies film Sangram (1950).Around this time, Dev Anand offered Dutt a job as a director in his new
                company, Navketan. Back in their time at Prabhat while both still new to the industry, Anand and Dutt
                reached an agreement that if Dutt were to become a filmmaker, he would hire Anand as his hero, and if
                Anand were to produce a film, he would use Dutt as its director. Keeping that promise, the duo made two
                super-hit films together in a row.</p>
            <p>First, Anand hired Dutt for Baazi (1951), starring Anand himself and marking Dutt's directorial debut.
                With its morally ambiguous hero, the transgressing siren, and shadow lighting, the film was a tribute to
                the 1940s film noir genre of Hollywood, and defined the noir genre for the following decade in
                Bollywood. Baazi, which was an immediate success, was followed by Jaal (1952), also directed by Dutt and
                starring Anand, and was again successful at the box office.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="title">Success</h3>
        <div class="des">
            <p>Contrary to a general belief about the viability of his film projects, Dutt more or less produced
                commercially successful films.Over the years the commercial nature of his projects saw a trade-off with
                his
                creative aspirations. Movies such as C.I.D., Baazi, Pyaasa, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Chaudhvin Ka Chand and
                Sahib
                Bibi Aur Ghulam were the first of their kind in Hindi cinema</p>
            <p>The only film produced by Dutt that was considered a box office disaster was <b>Kaagaz Ke Phool</b>,
                which is now a
                cult classic.The extra-feature on the DVD of <b>Kaagaz Ke Phool</b> has a three-part Channel 4-produced
                documentary
                on the life and works of Dutt titled In Search of Guru Dutt.</p>
            <p>He, along with Raj Kapoor, Mehboob Khan and Bimal Roy, was
                one of the few Indian film directors able to
                achieve a healthy blend of artistic and commercial success between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s. His
                brother
                Atma Ram dedicated his 1969 directorial Chanda Aur Bijli to him</p>

        <div class="des">
            <p>Dutt is known as a director<b> who used his imagination in relation to light and shade</b>, his evocative
                imagery, and a striking ability to weave multiple thematic layers into his narratives.</p>

            <p> Both <b>Kaagaz Ke Phool</b> and <b>Pyaasa</b> have been included among the greatest films of all time,
                as well as on Sight & Sound magazine's 2002 "Top Films Survey", which polled over 250 international film
                critics and directors. In 2005, <b>Pyaasa</b> made its way on to Time magazine's All-Time 100 Movies
                list.In 2010, Dutt was included among CNN's <b>"Top 25 Asian Actors of all time"</b>.</p>

            Pyaasa is a 1957 Indian Hindi drama film directed and produced by <b>Guru Dutt</b>, who stars alongside Mala Sinha, Waheeda Rehman, Rehman, and Johnny Walker. Set in Calcutta, it focuses on the disillusioned Urdu poet Vijay (Dutt), whose works are underestimated by publishers and panned for writing on social issues rather than romantic topics. The film follows his encounters with the golden-hearted prostitute Gulabo (Waheeda Rehman) and his former girlfriend Meena (Sinha), how the former helps him to get his poetry published, the success of his works, and his romantic relationship with Gulabo.
        </p>
        <p>The role of Vijay was initially offered to <b>Dilip Kumar</b> which he declined owing to the impact of doing intense films on his health. Later, in an interview, he also said that he found the character of Vijay in Pyaasa similar to that of <b>Devdas </b>and admitted Pyaasa was one of three movies he regretted turning down. Guru Dutt, later accepted the role himself and the film went on to become one of the most commercially successful movies of the year</p>
